Nice Presets

Some of my FFMPEG Batch Scripts I've kept as staples for quick video editing without waiting so long for something to initialize for something as simple as cropping or compressing video. Then you have to go to some shady phone app that will watermark it anyway, No more!

Batch scripts are basically a file that contains commands for the computer to complete and the flags on how to complete them. **HOWEVER**

**Please always doublecheck your sources for things like this, especially if you dont understand the code. Batch scripts can be useful for automation, but running them willy nilly without any context can certainly introduce a risk to your computer, so be careful.**

The reason I'm saying this is I want to be transparent and not give people an idea that theyre alawys harmless. I intend to try to explain at least a bit of the code myself, but to be completely honest I managaed this mostly with the help of stack overflow  and edits to suit my needs
