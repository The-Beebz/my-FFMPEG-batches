# my-FFMPEG-batches
Some of my FFMPEG Batch Scripts I've kept as staples for quick video editing without waiting so long for something to initialize for something as simple as cropping or compressing video. Then you have to go to some shady phone app that will watermark it anyway, No more!

Distributed mainly for the purposes of those in fandom spaces.

Easily clip your favorite parts of videos!
Compress bulky video to reduce size
Extract screenshots of an show episode
Crop, Shrink and onvert from mp3 to mp4 and back
You dont even need an internet connection!

# Usage Instructions

+ Requirements: [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Download the executable style for your OS. 
*These were intended for windows so you may have to delete extra percent signs for Linux. I have no idea how Mac parses it. *

* Download a batch file, or the entire source code to get them all
* Drag and drop a video on a batch script
* Edit the code to customize how the video is edited
* **I have added comments to each batch file explaining what each command does, which can be crossreferenced with the [ffmpeg documentation]()**

I made these because I was sick and tired of having to bounce between bulky, ugly and freemium bait and switch video editors for what feels like should just be simple edits. A batch script takes less time than even loading up DaVinci Resolve. It's a dream for me so I wanted to share them

# Batch File? What is it?
To keep it simple, Batch scripts are basically files that contains tasks for a computer to complete and how to complete them. **HOWEVER**

*Please always doublecheck your sources for things like this, especially if you dont understand the code. Batch scripts can be useful for automation, but running them willy nilly without any context can certainly introduce a risk to your computer, so be careful.*

The reason I'm saying this is I want to be transparent and not give people an idea that theyre alawys harmless. Not that I want to scare anyone, but just want people to be aware if they come across other files that may be malicious.
